Implement stack using array


Implement a Stack using an Array, where the size of the array, n is given.
The Stack must support the following operations:

(i) push(x): Insert an element x at the top of the stack.
(ii) pop(): Remove the element from the top of the stack.
(iii) peek(): Return the top element if not empty, else -1.
(iv) isEmpty(): Return true if the stack is empty else return false.
(v) isFull(): Return true if the stack is full else return false.

There will be a sequence of queries queries[][]. The queries are represented in numeric form:

1 x : Call push(x)

2 : Call pop()

3 : Call peek()

4  : Call isEmpty()

5 : Call isFull()

You just have to implement the functions push, pop, peek, isEmpty, and isFull. The driver code will handle the output.

Note: All the queries are valid.

Examples:

Input: n = 3, q = 6, queries[][] = [[1, 5], [1, 3], [3], [2], [4], [5]]
Output: [3, false, false]
Explanation: Queries on stack are as follows:
push(5) : Insert 5 at the top of the stack.
push(3) : Insert 3 at the top of the stack.
peek() : Return the top element i.e. 3.
pop() : Remove the top element i.e. 3.
isEmpty() : return false as the stack is not empty.
isFull() : return false as the stack is not full. Capacity = 3.
Input: n = 1, q = 5, queries[][] =  [[2], [3], [4], [1, 9], [5]]
Output: [-1, -1, true, true]
Explanation: Queries on stack are as follows:
pop(): Since stack is empty, nothing is popped.
peek(): Return the top element. Since the stack is empty, return -1.
isEmpty(): Return true as the stack is empty.
push(9): Insert 9 at the top of the stack. The stack will be [9].
isFull(): Return true as the stack is full. Capacity = 1.



SOLUTION :::

class myStack {
  private:
  int *st;
  int sz;
  int top;
    
  public:
    myStack(int n) {
        // Define Data Structures
        sz = n;
        st = new int[n];
        top = -1;
    }

    bool isEmpty() {
        // check if the stack is empty
        return top == -1;
    }

    bool isFull() {
        // check if the stack is full
        return top == sz - 1;
    }

    void push(int x) {
        // inserts x at the top of the stack
        if(isFull()) return;
        top++;
        st[top] = x;
    }

    void pop() {
        // removes an element from the top of the stack
        if(isEmpty()) return;
        top--;
    }

    int peek() {
        // Returns the top element of the stack
        if(isEmpty()) return -1;
        return st[top];
    }
};
